# Section 3: First Steps
Basic types, first exercises and challenges with java types and logic operators.

## Concepts

### Wrapper class

In object-oriented programming, a wrapper class is a class that encapsulates types, so that those types can be used to create object instances and methods in another class that need those types. So a primitive wrapper class is a wrapper class that encapsulates, hides or wraps data types from the eight primitive data types, so that these can be used to create instantiated objects with methods in another class or in other classes. The primitive wrapper classes are found in the Java API.

| Primitive type  	|  Wrapper class 	|   Constructor arguments	|
|---	|---	|---	  |
|   byte	|   Byte	  |   byte or String	         |
|   short	|   Short	  |   short or String	         |
|   int	    |   Integer	  |   int or String	             |
|   long	|   Long 	  |   long or String 	         |
|   float	|   Float	  |   float, double or String	 |
|   double	|   Double	  |   double or String	         |
|   char	|   Character |   char	                     |
|   boolean	|   Boolean   |   boolean or String          |

### Overflow and Underflow
Simply put, overflow and underflow happen when we assign a value that is out of range of the declared data type of the variable.
